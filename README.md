# investment_account

This project involves the creation of APIs to manage investment accounts.
Each user can hold three account types, named ACC1, ACC2, and ACC3.
An account must include the following attributes: a name, an owner, an account type, and a balance, which defaults to 0.

When the account balance changes, a transaction is recorded.
Withdrawals are represented as negative transactions, while deposits are recorded as positive values.
This ensures a clear and auditable trail for all balance adjustments.

#### Account Permissions

For **ACC1**, the user has **view-only** permissions, allowing them to access and view the account and its associated transactions.

For **ACC2**, the user has **full control** over the account and transactions, with the ability to **read, create, update, and delete** both the account and its transactions.

For **ACC3**, the user has permission to **create** the account, but no other actions (viewing, updating, or deleting) are allowed.
